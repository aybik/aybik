# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I work on **Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL)** projects, with a focus on **textual data**. I voluntarily develop models and applications in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, Information Retrieval, and AI-driven text analysis.

## What You'll Find Here
- **NLP Projects**: Sentiment analysis, topic modeling, text classification, and more.
- **Machine Learning Applications**: Supervised and unsupervised learning models for real-world problems.
- **Deep Learning Implementations**: Neural networks, transformers, and advanced DL architectures applied to text.
- **Data Science Experiments**: Exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model optimization.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers)
- **Data Processing**: NLTK, SpaCy, BERT, GPT-based models
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Databases**: SQL, BigQuery

## Let's Connect
I'm open to collaborations, discussions, and knowledge sharing. If you're interested in **AI, NLP, or ML**, feel free to reach out!
